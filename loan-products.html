                Fairway is not affiliated with any government agencies. These materials are not from HUD or FHA and were
                not approved by HUD or a government agency.  Reverse mortgage borrowers are required to obtain an
                eligibility certificate
                by receiving counseling sessions with a HUD-approved agency. Must be at least 62 years old. Loan
                proceeds are not considered income and will not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits. Your
                monthly reverse mortgage advances
                may affect your eligibility for some other programs.  Consult a local program office or your attorney to
                determine how, or if, monthly reverse mortgage payments might affect your specific situation.  At the
                conclusion of the term of the
                reverse mortgage loan contract, some or all of the equity in the property that is the subject of the
                reverse mortgage no longer belongs to you and you may need to sell or transfer the property to repay the
                proceeds of the reverse
                mortgage with interest from your assets.  We will charge an origination fee, a mortgage insurance
                premium, closing costs or servicing fees for the reverse mortgage, all or any of which we will add to
                the balance of the reverse
                mortgage loan.  The balance of the reverse mortgage loan grows over time and interest will be charged on
                the outstanding loan balance.  You retain title to the property that is the subject of the reverse
                mortgage until you sell or
                transfer the property and you are therefore responsible for paying property taxes, insurance, and
                maintenance.  Failing to pay these amounts may cause the reverse mortgage loan to become due
                immediately.  Interest on reverse
                mortgage is not deductible to your income tax return until you repay all or part of the reverse mortgage
                loan.</p>
